The "mv" cmd is used to move a specific file from one location to another. For example "mv fileToBeMoved ../fileToBeMoved. The
"mv" cmd takes two parameters. The first is the file name (and it's location if not in the current working directory) and
the second is where it will be moved to. In this case we didn't need to specifiy the path of fileToBeMoved because it was
already in our working directory. If the second parameter given is a different name to that of the original then the file
will be be renamed to the new given name.
